# Hotel Room Reservation System

A sophisticated web application that optimizes hotel room bookings based on travel time minimization across a 97-room hotel.

## üè® Hotel Structure

- **Floors 1-9**: 10 rooms each (101-110, 201-210, etc.)
- **Floor 10**: 7 rooms (1001-1007)
- **Total**: 97 rooms across 10 floors

## ‚ú® Features

### Core Functionality

- **Smart Booking Algorithm**: Automatically finds the optimal room combination that minimizes travel time
- **Travel Time Calculation**:
  - Horizontal: 1 minute per room on the same floor
  - Vertical: 2 minutes per floor using stairs/lift
- **Booking Rules**:
  - Maximum 5 rooms per booking
  - Priority to same-floor bookings
  - Cross-floor optimization when needed

### Interactive Interface

- **Real-time Visualization**: See all 97 rooms with color-coded status
- **Booking Controls**: Easy-to-use interface for room selection
- **Random Occupancy Generator**: Test different scenarios
- **Reset Functionality**: Clear all bookings and start fresh

### Visual Feedback

- üü¢ **Green**: Available rooms
- üî¥ **Gray**: Occupied rooms
- üü° **Gold**: Your booked rooms (with glow animation)

## üéØ How It Works

### Booking Algorithm

1. **Same-Floor Priority**: The system first tries to find all requested rooms on a single floor
2. **Consecutive Rooms**: Within a floor, it prioritizes consecutive room numbers (minimal horizontal travel)
3. **Cross-Floor Optimization**: If same-floor booking isn't possible, it uses a greedy algorithm to minimize total travel time
4. **Travel Time Calculation**: Considers both vertical (floor-to-floor) and horizontal (room-to-room) distances

### Example Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Same Floor Available**

- Request: 4 rooms
- Available on Floor 1: 101, 102, 105, 106
- Result: Books 101, 102, 105, 106 (minimal travel time)

**Scenario 2: Cross-Floor Booking**

- Request: 4 rooms
- Floor 1: Only 101, 102 available
- Floor 2: 201, 202 available
- Result: Books 101, 102, 201, 202 (optimized for minimal vertical travel)
